    <h1>What is AMI?</h1>
    <h2>A good question</h2>
    <p>
      What do art and technology have to do with each other? What is machine intelligence, and what does “machine intelligence art” look, sound and feel like? What are the emerging relationships between humans and machines; what does it mean to be human; and what can we learn about intelligence, human or otherwise, through art? How should we think about our future?
    </p>
    <h2>Scenario 1: Multi-line text elements larger than body text</h2>
    <h3>On the horizon</h3>
    <p>
      We’ll also try to think our way through the big questions in a series of essays. The first essay, Art in the Age of Machine Intelligence, introduces many of the themes we hope to develop over time in more detail.

      These are some of the questions we’ve been asking ourselves, especially in the wake of a series of breakthroughs in neural network-generated imagery beginning in the summer of 2015. Artists and Machine Intelligence is a long-term collaboration we’ve begun to explore these questions through art. It brings together artists and thinkers, researchers, engineers, and, of course, the machine intelligences these researchers and engineers are building.

    <h2>Scenario 3: Multi-line Text Elements with a Background</h2>
    <p>
      Example of a button with text that spans more than 1 line.
    </p>
    <p class="button">
      A button with two lines

    <h2>Repeating shapes</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some repeated shapes using a variant of the baseline vertical rhythm.
    </p>
    <div class="shapes">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="shape"></div>
        <div class="shape"></div>
        <div class="shape"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="shape"></div>
        <div class="shape"></div>
        <div class="shape"></div>
      </div>

      A super short paragraph to help evaluate the 0.75 baseline exercise in Module 2, Lesson 4.

    <h2>Integrating the four principles in a new component: Repetition, contrast, alignment, and proximity</h2>
    <blockquote cite="http://http://responsive-typography.zellwk.com/module-2/lesson-5">
      Design a component. Integrate these four design principles as you work through your component. This here is my custom blockquote component.

    <p>
      Since we want readers to move into, and out of a list like paragraphs, the margins between lists and paragraphs should be consistent (repetition).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <!-- Replace list items with actual content -->
      <li>Be specific</li>
      <li>Be clear and concise</li>
      <li>Show your work</li>
      <li>I (might) have answered your question before. You can search for them easily on the Github issues.</li>
      <li>It’s much easier for me to search through Github issues and point people towards the correct answers than write a new reply for every question that comes my way.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Check out that list style spacing and list item spacing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Great. Now that the vertical position of the list is set properly, we’ll look at the horizontal position. Here, we see that the browser has already indented list items inward for us.
